# Infinite-craft-toolkit
A utility to remember how to get specific items in [infinite craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/)!
Also allows you to create your own items.

[![Get the add-on!](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2020/04/get-the-addon-fx-apr-2020.svg)](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/infinite-craft-memorizer/)

It automatically monitors your web requests to the Infinite Craft API and remembers automatically how you made every item!

Stores the items in the add-on's localStorage, which is private to the add-on so no conflicts with other userscripts or add-ons!

Once you got it, you can get some pre-built data on [this GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/helloyanis/8b56a698dbbe37de8b8314961697fafc)!
